            <h2>What is Perfume?</h2>
            <p>Perfume is a liquid scent that is applied to the skin to create a pleasant fragrance. It is typically composed of three main components: top notes, middle notes, and base notes. Top notes are the lightest and most fleeting fragrances, followed by middle notes, which are more persistent, and finally, base notes, which are the most enduring fragrances.</p>
            <h2>Types of Perfume</h2>
            <p>There are several types of perfume, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eau de Toilette (EDT): This is the most common type of perfume. It is a light, fresh fragrance that is ideal for daytime wear.</li>
                <li>Eau de Parfum (EDP): EDP is a more concentrated version of EDT. It has a longer lasting fragrance and is ideal for both day and evening wear.</li>
                <li>Colognes: Colognes are a more concentrated form of perfume. They are typically used for aftershave and cologne. Colognes are also available in EDT and EDP varieties.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Choosing the Right Perfume</h2>
            <p>When choosing the right perfume, it is important to consider factors such as your skin type, the desired fragrance, and the occasion for which you will be wearing the perfume.</p>
